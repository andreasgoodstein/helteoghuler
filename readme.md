# Helte og Huler

Helte og Huler is a small hero management video game.

This is primarily a hobby project for me to learn more about video game development and Godot. As well as re-familiarize myself with C# and .NET

It contains the following projects:

## client

[The Godot game client](./client/readme.md)

## server

[A game server](./server/readme.md)

## shared

[A shared class library](./shared/readme.md)

## test

[The test library for this project](./test/readme.md)

## todo

Enable abilities, crits, and dodges.
