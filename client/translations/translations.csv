A place of Heroes!

A place of horrors...

You used to be a Hero. Before you took a battleaxe to the knee, leaving
you quite mono-pedal.

Perhaps you've learned a lesson about picking fights with
ill-disposed minotaurs?

Alas, with your adventuring days over
a quiet retirement seems your only option.

However it seems that the local rule, The Marquee, heard of
your plight, and deemed you worthy of a boon.

A deed! To your very own Inn.

What possibilities could this opportunity unlock? 
What riches can yet be gained?

Only time will tell.

First things first...
What name do you sign on your deed?";

above the stout oaken door?";
