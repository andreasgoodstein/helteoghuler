A place of Heroes!

A place of horrors...

You used to be a Hero. Before you took a battleaxe to the knee, leaving
you quite mono-pedal.

Perhaps you've learnt a leason about picking fights with minotaurs?

Alas, with your adventuring days over
a quiet retirement seems your only option.

However it seems that the local rule, The Marquee, heard of
your plight, and deemed you worthy of a boon.

A deed! To your very own Inn.

What possibilities could this opportunity unlock? 
What riched can yet be gained?

Only time will tell.

First things first...
What name do you sign on your deed?"
